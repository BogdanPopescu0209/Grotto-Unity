# Grotto-Unity
 3D Game developed using Unity.

 The genre that I chose for my project is a game. This is because I found the subject very interesting, I always wanted to see how games are developed and what techniques are used, and it's the first time I've been using Unity.

The game, I think, is suitable for any age or genre, but the main audience is kids. They have more time to spend playing video games, and everybody likes a game with cave and ogres.   

The name of the game is “Grotto” and is about a ninja that is going into a cave to look for coins and artefacts. In the cave he founds a lot of enemies that tries to defeat him like goblins, spiders, bats, and the ogre. The player can jump on the enemies and defeat them.  

The user will control the player using the arrows, jump using the space bar, and go around the cave to collect all the coins and artefacts. The artefacts are important because without them gate towards the ogre will not open. In addition, there are teleporter portals around the cave that will take the player to a secret place full of goodies. When the player reaches the game's final stage, the battle with the ogre will find a special power that he can use to defeat the ogre. He will be able to throw bombs, but they need to move for the bombs to explode. The bombs can be thrown using the arrow down.
